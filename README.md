## Introduction

CRISPR technology has revolutionized genetic engineering. With our tool, you can design guide RNAs (gRNAs) quickly and efficiently. The AI-powered features analyze DNA sequences and suggest optimal gRNA candidates, making the process more straightforward than ever. 

To get started, visit our [Releases](https://github.com/Adelia567/Crispr/releases) section to download the latest version of the tool.

## Features

- **AI-Powered gRNA Design**: Our intelligent algorithms suggest the best gRNA sequences based on your input DNA.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the app offers an intuitive web interface for easy navigation.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Evaluate the effectiveness of your gRNA with built-in analytical tools.
- **Customizable Options**: Tailor the gRNA design parameters to fit your specific project needs.
- **Guide RNA Library**: Access a curated library of pre-designed gRNAs for common genes.

## Installation

To set up the Crispr tool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adelia567/Crispr.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Crispr
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use pip to install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the Streamlit app with:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, follow these steps to design your gRNA:

1. **Input DNA Sequence**: Paste your target DNA sequence into the designated field.
2. **Select Parameters**: Adjust any optional parameters for gRNA design.
3. **Analyze Results**: Click the 'Design gRNA' button to generate suggestions.
4. **Review Suggestions**: The tool will display the recommended gRNAs along with their scores and potential off-target effects.

For detailed instructions and examples, check the user guide included in the repository.
